# üîç EZREC Project Comprehensive Audit Report

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### 1. **DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUES**

- ‚ùå **MISSING ANON KEY**: Your .env file is missing `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` which is needed for database queries
- ‚ùå **WRONG TABLE TARGET**: Code is querying `bookings` table but database shows recent bookings in different format
- ‚ùå **CAMERA_ID MISMATCH**: .env has `raspberry_pi_camera_01` but database shows various camera IDs

### 2. **VIDEO UPLOAD ISSUES**

- ‚ùå **MISSING STORAGE3**: Upload script requires `storage3` library but may not be installed
- ‚ùå **WRONG BUCKET NAME**: Code uploads to `videos` bucket but needs verification
- ‚ùå **METADATA NOT UPLOADING**: Videos metadata goes to `recordings` table, not `videos` table
- ‚ùå **INCONSISTENT PATHS**: Uses local paths instead of Supabase storage paths

### 3. **BOOKING SYSTEM ISSUES**

- ‚ùå **CAMERA_ID FILTERING**: `get_next_booking()` filters by CAMERA_ID but database has multiple camera IDs
- ‚ùå **TIME ZONE PROBLEMS**: Booking times may not match system timezone
- ‚ùå **BOOKING COMPLETION**: Bookings may not be properly marked as completed

### 4. **CONFIGURATION ISSUES**

- ‚ùå **BASE_DIR MISMATCH**: .env points to `/home/michomanoly14892/code/EZREC-BackEnd` but service expects `/opt/ezrec-backend`
- ‚ùå **MISSING ENVIRONMENT VARS**: Several required variables missing
- ‚ùå **INCONSISTENT SERVICE CONFIG**: Service and repository paths don't match

## üîß **REQUIRED FIXES**

### Fix 1: Database Connection & Environment

### Fix 2: Video Upload System Overhaul

### Fix 3: Booking System Repair

### Fix 4: Path & Configuration Alignment

## üìä **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

Based on database queries, your system shows:

- ‚úÖ 2 active bookings in database
- ‚úÖ 70 videos already uploaded (but to wrong table structure)
- ‚úÖ 4 recordings in `recordings` table
- ‚úÖ 5 cameras registered
- ‚úÖ System status actively updating

The foundation is working but routing to wrong destinations!
